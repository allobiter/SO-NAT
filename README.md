## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ (Recommended: Python 3.8+)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on model selection)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- OpenCV (optional, for image datasets)

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allobiter/SO-NAT.git
cd SO-NAT
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run **SO-NAT** via the command-line interface to train AI models with ease. Below are the basic usage steps:

### 1. Start the CLI

Run the following command to launch the CLI:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. Select a Model

After starting the CLI, you will be prompted to choose from various predefined models:

- Neural Network (Feedforward)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest

### 3. Dataset Selection

You can either:
- **Upload Your Own Dataset**: Provide a path to your custom dataset file (CSV, image folder, etc.).
- **Use Default Dataset**: Select from the built-in datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10) suitable for various model types.

### 4. Model Configuration and Hyperparameters

Configure hyperparameters such as:
- Learning rate
- Number of epochs
- Batch size
- Optimizer selection (e.g., Adam, SGD)

**SO-NAT** will suggest default values for each parameter, or you can choose to adjust them manually.

### 5. Training the Model

Once configuration is complete, initiate the training process:

```bash
python train_model.py --model cnn --epochs 50 --batch-size 32 --learning-rate 0.001
```

### 6. Model Evaluation

After training completes, the model's performance will be evaluated and key metrics will be displayed, including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Loss

### 7. Model Saving and Deployment

Once satisfied with the model performance, you can save it for future use or deployment.

```bash
python save_model.py --model cnn --output-path models/cnn_model.h5
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Model Fine-Tuning

**SO-NAT** supports advanced fine-tuning for pretrained models, enabling users to transfer knowledge from pre-existing models and further optimize them for specific tasks.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning

For advanced users, **SO-NAT** integrates an automatic hyperparameter optimization system that uses grid search or randomized search techniques to find the optimal settings for training.

### 3. Multi-GPU Training

If you have multiple GPUs available, **SO-NAT** can automatically distribute the training workload across all available devices, drastically improving training times for complex models.

### 4. Cross-Validation

To ensure model robustness, **SO-NAT** supports k-fold cross-validation for more reliable performance metrics, especially when working with smaller datasets.

### 5. Visualization

Use built-in visualizations for better understanding and interpretation of the model training process:
- Training and validation loss curves
- Accuracy curves
- Confusion matrix
- ROC/AUC curve

```bash
python visualize.py --model cnn
```

## Customization

### 1. Custom Model Definition

You can extend **SO-NAT** by defining your own models. To do this, subclass the `BaseModel` class and implement your custom architecture. Ensure to specify the forward pass and backpropagation methods.

### 2. Dataset Handling

If you wish to work with a custom dataset, you can create your own dataset loader class that integrates seamlessly with **SO-NAT**. The framework supports both tabular and image datasets.

### 3. Optimizer Plugins

For advanced users, **SO-NAT** allows you to implement custom optimizers and loss functions. Simply create a new class and plug it into the training pipeline.
